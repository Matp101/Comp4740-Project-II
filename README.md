# 4730-Project-II

We will use the [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification/overview) problem on Kaggle.

## The final project

Form a group of 3 or 4 students. Select a Kaggle.com competition either in vision, GNN or NLP, and make a research data analysis project using deep learning approaches. You should use your own initiative to define one or several research questions and use the resources available, based on the Python libraries (in particular Pytorch or Keras), to apply different deep learning approaches on this data to predict accurately the class of the unlabeled data and to answer your research questions. You should try to build a model as performant as possible for the selected task(s). You need to evaluate your model accuracy compared to other existing models. You need to evaluate how each properties/characteristic of your model affect the overall accuracy. You have to write a paper (minimum 8 pages, maximum 10 pages) about your project similar to a research paper for a publication. This implies a state of art, a presentation of the research questions School of Computer Science - Page 3 of 6 and the chosen methods to tackle them, a presentation of the results and discussion and a conclusion/future work. You will have to provide the Python codes you developed for this project.
